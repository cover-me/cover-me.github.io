I made the blog by following [this](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) article. It says that one can set up the website running with GitHub Pages and Jekyll in an afternoon. I spent two afternoons over the weekend, however, because I struggled with making further modifications to these files. I like the idea of developing a GitHub Pages blog in a browser without installing Git/Ruby/Jekyll. I am an idiot that only after finishing the blog I realized there must be a Jekyll engine running behind GitHub Pages. I just uploaded raw .md files and .html templates. GitHub Pages would take care of the rest.

So, sounds like an old saying, what is the meaning of this blog? Maybe for practicing my English writing skill, or sharing pieces of draft thought about physics and something related. I used to have several blogs before. But I haven't used them for a long time. I still remember the first time I modified a .css file. And now I am doing such things again. If the day comes when a blog is not read by people anymore, maybe we can throw that blog into the universe by a radio.

Now the blog has been set. I am going to discover the winter sunshine outside.
