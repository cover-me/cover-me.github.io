I forked a [project](https://github.com/cover-me/qtplot) called qtplot from [Rubenknex](https://github.com/Rubenknex/qtplot). I want to show demo videos in the README.md but failed. So I upload the videos here and put the links in README.md.


1. Show real-time data when measuring with [qtlab](https://github.com/heeres/qtlab).

...<video source src="/images/qtplot_with_qtlab.mp4" type="video/mp4" controls preload></video>

2. Plot with data and reproduce the figure.
