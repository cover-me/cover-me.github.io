title: The first post
---
I built this blog by following this [article](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). It suggests that one can set up a website running by GitHub Pages and Jekyll in a single afternoon. I spent two afternoons at the weekend because I struggled with webpage styles. I enjoyed the idea of developing a GitHub-Pages-blog with a web browser. Just forget the Git/Ruby/Jekyll. There is a magic engine called Jekyll running behind the GitHub Pages. I create, modify, or upload MD/HTML files in a browser. The GitHub Pages takes care of the rest.

So what is the motivation for making this blog? Maybe for practicing my English writing skill, and sharing pieces of draft thought about physics or something related (sometimes with errors ðŸ˜³). I had several blogs before. The memory that I modified a CSS file is so ancient. Now I am doing it again. If the day comes that no blog is read by anyone anymore, maybe we can throw posts into the universe by a radio.
