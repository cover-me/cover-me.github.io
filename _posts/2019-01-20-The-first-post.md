title: The first post
---
I made this blog by following the article [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). It says that one can set up a website running by GitHub Pages and Jekyll in one afternoon. I spent an extra afternoon at the weekend because I struggled with webpage styles. I enjoyed the idea of developing a GitHub-Pages-blog with only a web browser. Just forget about Git/Ruby/Jekyll. I am an idiot that not until finished the blog I realized there must be a Jekyll engine running behind GitHub Pages. I just uploaded .md files and .html templates. GitHub Pages takes care of the rest.

So what is the motivation of this blog? Maybe for practicing my English writing skill, and sharing pieces of draft thought about physics and something related. I had several blogs before. The memory that I modified a .css file is so ancient. Now I am doing it again. If the day comes that no blog is read by anyone anymore, we can throw posts into the universe by a radio.

The blog is built. I am happy to go outside to discover winter sunshine.
