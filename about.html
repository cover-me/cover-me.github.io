		How do I get the name for this website?
		First, I steal the idea of "Zero-bias Zoo" from slide 25 in this <a href="http://boulderschool.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Frolov_boulder2016_lecture1.pdf">lecture</a>.
		Secondly, Phy-Phy-Physics sounds cool to me.

		The pictures below are physical signals playing in the park. What are they playing? They are playing a black hole ring 💍,  a hurricane 🌀, a spider 🕷️, a turtle 🐢, and so on.

		The characters at the bottom are random Chinese poems, got from <a href="https://gushi.ci/">here</a>, to add some flavor of poetry.
